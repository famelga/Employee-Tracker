## Description 


This Employee Tracker is a content management system(CMS) that manages a company's employee database from the command-line using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Business owners can both view and add departments, roles, and employeesm. Additionally, the roles of employees can also be update.

## Portfolio Example

When referencing the role table in the addEmployee function, the inclusion of the salary column was resulting in a null response. 


```
function addEmployee() {
    db.findAllRoles()
    .then(([rows]) => {
        let roles = rows;
        const roleChoices=roles.map(({id, title, salary}) => ({
            name: title,
            value: id,
            value: salary,
        }))

```

Since the salary is linked to the role that already exists, I only needed to focus on updating the role - not the salary. Removing the salary as a value allowed for employees to be added properly.

```
function addEmployee() {
    db.findAllRoles()
    .then(([rows]) => {
        let roles = rows;
        const roleChoices=roles.map(({id, title}) => ({
            name: title,
            value: id,
        }))

```


## Usage 

Use the command-line to view and interact with information that is stored in the databse.


## Learning Points 

This application helped me understand the functionality of switch cases. Using these simplified that steps that were necessary to execute each function.
